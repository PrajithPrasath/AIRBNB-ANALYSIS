# AIRBNB ANALYSIS - Data Exploration and Visualization<br>
**Overview:**<br>
The Airbnb Analysis project is a Streamlit web application designed to explore and visualize Airbnb data, providing insights into pricing trends, availability patterns, and geographic distributions. It leverages Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization to create interactive and informative visualizations.<br>

**Import Libraries**<br>
-import git<br>
-import pandas as pd<br>
-import json<br>
-import seaborn as sns<br>
-import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
-import plotly.express as px<br>
-import numpy as np<br>
-import streamlit as st<br>

-Cloned the Airbnb dataset from the GitHub repository for analysis.<br>

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**<br>
**Conducted thorough data cleaning:**<br>
-Handled missing values and removed duplicates.<br>
-Transformed necessary data types for analysis.<br>
-Replaced country codes for choropleth visualizations.<br>

**Geospatial Visualization**<br>
**Utilized geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive folium maps:**<br>
-Visualized the distribution of listings across different locations.<br>
-Enabled exploration of prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.<br>

**Analysis and Visualization**<br>
**Leveraged Python Plotly for detailed analysis and visualization:**<br>
